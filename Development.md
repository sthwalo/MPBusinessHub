## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/businesses/register` - Register a new business
- `GET /api/businesses` - Get all businesses with optional filtering
- `GET /api/businesses/check` - Get businesses for the directory
- `GET /api/businesses/{id}` - Get details for a specific business
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user and get token

### Protected Endpoints (require authentication)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout and invalidate token
- `GET /api/business/details` - Get authenticated user's business details
- `PUT /api/business/update` - Update authenticated user's business profile
- `PUT /api/business/social-media` - Update business social media links
- `POST /api/business/social-media/feature` - Create a social media feature post (Silver and Gold tiers)
- `POST /api/packages/upgrade` - Upgrade business package

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design

The project uses PostgreSQL with the following key tables:
- `users`: Stores user authentication information
- `businesses`: Contains business profiles with JSON columns for flexible data
- `operating_hours`: Stores business operating hours
- `products`: Contains business products for catalog display
- `reviews`: Stores customer reviews and ratings
- `packages`: Defines the available membership tiers

### Backend Architecture

The Laravel backend follows a clean architecture with:
- Controllers for handling HTTP requests
- Models for database interaction
- Services for business logic
- Middleware for authentication and feature access control
- API routes with proper versioning

Key architectural decisions:
- Using JSON columns for flexible data storage (like social_media)
- Implementing proper validation and error handling
- Following RESTful API design principles
- Using Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication

### Frontend Architecture

The React frontend is organized with:
- Pages for main routes
- Components for reusable UI elements
- Hooks for shared logic
- Context for state management
- Utility functions for common operations

Key frontend patterns:
- Component composition for reusable UI
- Custom hooks for data fetching and business logic
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Proper form validation and error handling

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Tier-Based Feature Access

**Problem:** Implementing a system where features are conditionally available based on membership tier.

**Solution:** Created a centralized tier configuration system in `tierConfig.js` that defines feature availability for each tier. Implemented utility functions in `featureCheck.js` to check feature access throughout the application. This approach provides a single source of truth for tier-based features.

### Challenge 2: Social Media Integration

**Problem:** Implementing a flexible system for storing and displaying various social media platforms while maintaining proper validation.

**Solution:** Used a JSON column in the database to store social media links, allowing for flexible addition of new platforms. Created reusable components for displaying social media icons with proper validation. Implemented tier-based allocation of social media features with a monthly counter.

### Challenge 3: API Error Handling

**Problem:** Ensuring consistent error handling across all API endpoints.

**Solution:** Implemented a standardized error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes. Added try-catch blocks with detailed logging to help with debugging. Created frontend error handling utilities to display user-friendly error messages.

### Challenge 4: Deployment Configuration

**Problem:** Configuring the application for deployment with proper environment variables and build processes.

**Solution:** Created a comprehensive deployment configuration in `render.yaml` for the Render platform. Fixed path issues in Dockerfiles to ensure proper builds. Implemented environment-specific configuration for development and production.

### Challenge 5: Null Reference Errors

**Problem:** Components throwing errors when expected data was missing or undefined.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive null checks in components, particularly for rating display, website URL handling, and WhatsApp number. Implemented optional chaining and default values to gracefully handle missing data.
